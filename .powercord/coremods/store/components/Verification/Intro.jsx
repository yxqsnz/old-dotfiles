          The Powercord Verification Program rewards plugin and theme developers for being part of what makes the
          Powercord ecosystem what it is today, by making outstanding products and keeping them up to date. Verified
          products have a very nice verified checkmark next to their name, as well as a dedicated category.
        </p>
        <h2 className={size32}>What do I need to get verified?</h2>
        <p className={`${size16} ${marginBottom20}`}>
          We want the verified checkmark to be a sign of quality. That's why for verified products we have an additional
          set of requirements your product must abide by to get the ultimate sign of quality. Please note that the
          list is not exhaustive and we may at our sole discretion reject products in line with what's below.
